# CSS-Table-Design
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language. It is used to control the layout and design of web pages, including the design of tables.

To design a table using CSS, you can use various properties such as:

border: to add borders around the table cells
border-collapse: to control whether the borders of adjacent cells should be combined
width and height: to set the dimensions of the table
text-align: to align the text within the cells
background-color: to set the background color of the table and cells
padding: to add space within the cells
font-size and color: to set the font size and color of the text in the cells
You can also use CSS classes or id's to target specific elements of the table, such as the <th> (table header) or <td> (table data) elements, and apply different styles to them.
